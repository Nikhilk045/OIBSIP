I developed this Iris Flower Classification using Python Colaboratory Framework.

I am doing this internship at Oasis infobyte under the data science domain, under that I have completed 3 tasks which is given throughout the internship. For this full project work I have used the Google Colaboratory which is a very amazing tool. More details is provided below.

Throughout the internship I have completed 3 tasks and the 1st task is:

TASK 1: IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION 

Iris Flower has 3 species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Verginica, which differs according to their measurement. Based on the sepal and petal length and width we are classifying the flower whether the flower belongs from Setosa Versicolor or Verginica. By using the python and applies the machine learning algorithm for training the model and generates output. Requirements google Colaboratory libraries like:

      1. numpy
      2. pandas
      3. scikit-learn
      4. matplotlib 

This model used Logistic Regression.
